## Understanding MVP Testing: What's the Focus?

An MVP fundamentally tests two critical aspects of a product:

*   **Value Proposition:** Does the core functionality of your product solve a real problem for your target audience? Does it offer enough value to attract early adopters? This is about validating if your product idea resonates with potential users.
*   **Usability:** Is your product easy to use and understand? Can users navigate through the core features without significant frustration? This focuses on the user experience and identifying areas for improvement in the product's design and functionality.

These two aspects are intertwined. A product with a great value proposition but poor usability will likely fail. Similarly, a highly usable product that doesn't solve a real problem is pointless.

## Digging Deeper: Beyond the Two Core Aspects

While value and usability are paramount, MVPs also indirectly test other important elements:

*   **Market Demand:** The response to your MVP provides valuable insights into the overall market demand for your product. Are people willing to pay for what you're offering?
*   **Business Model Feasibility:** Can you acquire customers sustainably? Does the MVP help you validate key assumptions about your pricing and revenue streams?
